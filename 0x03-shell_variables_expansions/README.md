## More Info

Read your  `/etc/profile`,  `/etc/inputrc`  and  `~/.bashrc`  files.

Look at some files in the  `/etc/profile.d`  directory.

Note: You do not have to learn about  `awk`,  `tar`,  `bzip2`,  `date`,  `scp`,  `ulimit`,  `umask`, or shell scripting, yet.

### Manual QA Review

**It is your responsibility to request a review for your blog from a peer before the project’s deadline. If no peers have been reviewed, you should request a review from a TA or staff member.**
